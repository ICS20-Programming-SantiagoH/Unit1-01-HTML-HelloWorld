    <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
    <p>Hi, my name is Santiago Hewett and I am a grade 10 student at Immaculata high school.</p>
    <h2>My favorite pastime.</h2>
    <p>My favorite pastime is playing Fifa 23 with friends because me and my friends love the sport of soccer and during
    the winter that is the only way we can play it together.</p>

    <h2>My least favorite subject.</h2>
    <p>My least favorite subject is religion because I find it very boring and I don't think I learn very much in it. All
    they teach in the course is how to fill out useless worksheets and how to be a good samaritaine, I've been learning
    how to be a good sameritane since I was 4 years old.</p>
